# MarsMarine
Mars Marine game created in Unreal Engine Blueprint for the Udemy "Unreal Engine Blueprint Game Developer" course

Tools used: Unreal Engine 4.27.2

Build and compile using Unreal Engine 4.27+

Waves of aliens will spawn across the map and you have to kill them to survive. Move your mouse to aim your weapon, then press left mouse button to fire. Move your character using WASD keys with the keyboard. With the gamepad, use right thumbstick to aim, and right trigger to fire. Use the left thumbstick to move your character. After a wave is defeated, the game passes to the next wave with increased difficulty. Health pickup objects will spawn on the map after a certain time (which will become longer to respawn as the difficulty increases). Move to them to restore health of your character. If you move away from the mission area, or your health reaches zero, the game is over.
